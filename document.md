## Key Take-aways
### Dennis Mugo
Over the course of my learning, I have gained practical experience with essential GitHub project management tools. I have learned how to **create issues** to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests, and how to assign them to collaborators. I can now set up **milestones** to group related issues and monitor project progress toward specific goals. I have also understood how to initiate and manage **pull requests**, enabling code reviews and collaborative development. Additionally, I have become proficient in organizing tasks using **storyboards (project boards)**, which provide a visual workflow for tracking issue statuses using columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". These skills have equipped me to contribute effectively in collaborative software development environments.
