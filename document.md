## Key Take-aways
### Dennis Mugo
Over the course of my learning, I have gained practical experience with essential GitHub project management tools. I have learned how to **create issues** to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests, and how to assign them to collaborators. I can now set up **milestones** to group related issues and monitor project progress toward specific goals. I have also understood how to initiate and manage **pull requests**, enabling code reviews and collaborative development. Additionally, I have become proficient in organizing tasks using **storyboards (project boards)**, which provide a visual workflow for tracking issue statuses using columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". These skills have equipped me to contribute effectively in collaborative software development environments.


### Hawiana Abebe
During this Github crash course, I have learnt many essential aspects and features of both Github and Git. I have learned how to solve **merge conflicts** and track updates made to projects through **project boards** and **issues**. I have also understood the importance of protecting a main branch for personal projects and using separate branches for different tasks during development of a project. I have become more confident in using Github, as well as the git commands on the terminal. Through efficiently using one repository, I have learnt how to work better as a group to keep code clean and digestable.
