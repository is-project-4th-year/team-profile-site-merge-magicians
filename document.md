## Key Take-aways
### Dennis Mugo
Over the course of my learning, I have gained practical experience with essential GitHub project management tools. I have learned how to **create issues** to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests, and how to assign them to collaborators. I can now set up **milestones** to group related issues and monitor project progress toward specific goals. I have also understood how to initiate and manage **pull requests**, enabling code reviews and collaborative development. Additionally, I have become proficient in organizing tasks using **storyboards (project boards)**, which provide a visual workflow for tracking issue statuses using columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". These skills have equipped me to contribute effectively in collaborative software development environments.

This GitHub crash course provided hands-on experience with essential tools for collaborative software development. I learned how to create and manage issues, assign them and use labels like `bug`, `feature`, and `refactor` to organize and prioritize tasks. I also learned how to create custom labels, such as the `team profile` label, to suit specific project needs. Additionally, I explored how to group issues using milestones and track progress visually with project boards using workflows like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." I learned how to name branches clearly—often using the issue number and description (e.g., `feature/12-add-profile-section`)—and create branches directly from issues to keep work traceable and organized. Working with branches and managing pull requests gave me practical experience in proposing changes and conducting code reviews, and I developed the ability to resolve merge conflicts—an essential skill in collaborative environments. I also practiced writing clear and meaningful commit messages that reflect the purpose of each change, improving collaboration and code history readability. Overall, the course equipped me with the tools and workflows needed to contribute effectively to modern team-based projects using GitHub.
