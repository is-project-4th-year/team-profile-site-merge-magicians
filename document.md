## Key Take-aways
### Dennis Mugo
Over the course of my learning, I have gained practical experience with essential GitHub project management tools. I have learned how to **create issues** to track bugs, tasks, or feature requests, and how to assign them to collaborators. I can now set up **milestones** to group related issues and monitor project progress toward specific goals. I have also understood how to initiate and manage **pull requests**, enabling code reviews and collaborative development. Additionally, I have become proficient in organizing tasks using **storyboards (project boards)**, which provide a visual workflow for tracking issue statuses using columns such as "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done". I have also learnt about **git rebase** These skills have equipped me to contribute effectively in collaborative software development environments.



### Hawiana Abebe
During this Github crash course, I have learnt many essential aspects and features of both Github and Git. I have learned how to solve **merge conflicts** and track updates made to projects through **project boards** and **issues**. I have also understood the importance of protecting a main branch for personal projects and using separate branches for different tasks during development of a project. I have become more confident in using Github, as well as the git commands on the terminal. Through efficiently using one repository, I have learnt how to work better as a group to keep code clean and digestable.



### Michelle Oanda
This GitHub crash course provided hands-on experience with essential tools for collaborative software development. I learned how to create and manage issues, assign them and use labels like `bug`, `feature`, and `refactor` to organize and prioritize tasks. I also learned how to create custom labels, such as the `team profile` label, to suit specific project needs. Additionally, I explored how to group issues using milestones and track progress visually with project boards using workflows like "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." I learned how to name branches clearly—often using the issue number and description (e.g., `feature/12-add-profile-section`)—and create branches directly from issues to keep work traceable and organized. Working with branches and managing pull requests gave me practical experience in proposing changes and conducting code reviews, and I developed the ability to resolve merge conflicts—an essential skill in collaborative environments. I also practiced writing clear and meaningful commit messages that reflect the purpose of each change, improving collaboration and code history readability. Overall, the course equipped me with the tools and workflows needed to contribute effectively to modern team-based projects using GitHub.

### Patricia Wangu
Participating in the GitHub crash course has provided me with a strong foundation in version control and collaborative development. I have learned how to:
- Create and manage branches to work on features independently.
- Stage, commit and push changes to a remote repository using Git.
- Open and manage pull requests for team-based collaboration.
- Resolve merge conflicts effectively and understand their underlying causes.
- Utilize issues and project boards to organize tasks and monitor progress.
- Apply best practices when writing clear and descriptive commit messages.
